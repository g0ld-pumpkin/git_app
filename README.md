## Introduction

View repository and user information, control your notifications and even manage your issues and pull requests. Built with React Native, GitPoint is one of the most feature-rich unofficial GitHub clients that is 100% free.

**Available for both iOS and Android.**

## Features

A few of the things you can do with GitPoint:

* View user activity feed
* Communicate on your issue and pull request conversations
* Close or lock issues
* Apply labels and assignees
* Review and merge pull requests
* Create new issues
* Star, watch and fork repositories
* Control your unread and participating notifications
* Easily search for any user or repository

## Build Process

* Follow the [React Native Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for getting started building a project with native code. **A Mac is required if you wish to develop for iOS.**
* Clone or download the repo
* `yarn` to install dependencies
* `yarn run link` to link react-native dependencies
* `yarn start:ios` to start the packager and run the app in the iOS simulator (`yarn start:ios:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger))
* `yarn start:android` to start the packager and run the app in the the Android device/emulator (`yarn start:android:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger))

**Development Keys**: The `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `api/index.js` are for development purposes and do not represent the actual application keys. Feel free to use them or use a new set of keys by creating an [OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) of your own. Set the "Authorization callback URL" to `gitpoint://welcome`.
